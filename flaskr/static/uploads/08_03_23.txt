I'm writing this entry because I can't contain myself, and I don't know who I can trust. There are two men in my life right now, and my situation about them and myself is uncomfortable.

DAVE:
-Naa siyay genuine feelings sa ako
-He wants to court me but not as of the moment, he wants to settle himself sa
kay his intentions to me is for "forever"
-Dili nako need i reciprocate iyang feelings, kay given ra daw ni niya...
but idk what his expectations are so mangutana pa ko tonight
-Friends ang label namo atm 

I want to ask him sa iyang expectations sa ako and sa among relationship kay wala man nawala iyang feelings nako despite me rejecting him. I don't want to hurt the guy and at the same time, waste his time and effort. So personally it's best nga makabalo ko sa iyang expectations para sad ma grounded iyang time and effort.

We had a past, he made me realize things about myself at the same time helped me grow. But I'm not as committed as him. I like him as a person BUT there are things that bothers me... wala pa sad mi ga kita in person maong dili jud ko maka decide as of the moment... sometimes I have this dilemma of how lucky I am for him but dili siya permananent. I don't know what or how love really works but if I'm this bothered then I guess dili pa jud ko ready mo commit og relationship sa iyaha. As of the moment dili ko gusto magpadala og ayo sa iyang na feel, it's hard honestly, how I wish he would just give up on me...


BOB:
-Classmates mi, and I guess 'friends', I'm not sure kay sa personal wala man kaayo mi ga interact but from time to time naga chat mi.
-He's somewhat showing signs that he's interested with me BUT whether its romantic or pure curiousity lang dili nako matubag.


He intrigues me as a person kay I feel he's somewhat similar sa ako so I guess it's justifiable ngano gusto ko maila siya... for whether I'm doing this because I like him or not, I don't know but I have to check on myself nga dili ko padala sa akong pagka delulu.



MY INTERNALIZATION:
TBH I'm not looking for anyone BUT I am aware of my own interests, I want to feel what it feels to have someone special. Siguro boring lang jud akong life maong ingon ani ko. The two men are great, they have their own uniqueness. If I were to date them, hmmm, siguro ang act lang nga dating ok ko but being committed? I guess wala pa na sa akong mind, kini guro mismo nga idea is enough to justify how I MUST NOT be easily swayed by my own emotions way too often. Then again I'm not really the type of person who understands their own emotions so it's hard for me to discern whether I like a person as a human or as an individual whom I truly adore... Siguro I'm just afraid of a lot of things... maka ingon ko nga "ganahan" ko sa tawo but by the time they show signs of wanting to deepen the bond... I'm afraid... afraid of getting hurt.... of hurting them with my own circumstances... I guess my idea of perfection is way out of hand at this point... relationships are draining me way too often especially when they take a lot of time for my own. I want it to be natural but dili sad ko open, fml. 

A lot of my peers would say nga "let loose", or, "just be in the moment"... but everytime I do, I oftentimes contemplate afterwards and at some point I despise what I did... idk, it feels like the idea of being controlled by my own emotions and I can't justify or rationalize it makes me feel "dumb" and "weak"... How I wish I could... idk... feel my emotions without giving it a second thought afterwards... or like the idea lang guro nga akong utok, akong thoughts... will coincide with my own emotions.

Siguro... I'm just overly structured within... like there are things that I believe ingon ana mahitabo but when it does not murag ma stress na dayun ko... and I guess with relationships, especially around people who wants to deepen their bond to me, I feel intimidated by how I feel about them... and when I try to express my feelings, try to talk it with them naa siyay sense of relief. Pero after kay I feel distasteful... like siguro murag feel nako vulnerable kaayo ko and na pa kita nako na sa ilaha feel nako i atake ko nila anytime... fuck... I guess for the longest of time, even now, every time I show my emotions and, my inner thoughts I feel vulnerable and I expect the person in front of me will handle me with care... but they always end up hurting me... and everytime they do a part of me always justifies that feeling that I shouldn't just have said anything, "told you so".
